# Miscellanea
Bunch of scripts and docs for personal use only

## What you need to know
1. The `finder` script in /Shell is not that useful. You can toggle hidden files using **Command + Shift + .**
2. These things are either just useful to me or just some notes. You may not like them and they may not be helpful to you.
3. This repository is just a silly cloud backup, since the Developer folder on my Mac only has local backups. (Yeah I know, I can’t call this “backup”.)
4. Stuff in macOS System-Related Shell Commands.md may be dangerous. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
